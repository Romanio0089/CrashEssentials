*CrashEssentials* is a Bukkit plugin that provides an essential set of commands used to crash Minecraft clients or potentially servers. It also offers commands to fake crash a client.

*CrashEssentials* is still essentially a proof of concept, and currently only offers two commands. See more below.

Compatibility: 1.7.X up to 1.17.X (higher versions have not been tested yet).

Please note that development is currently on hiatus. However, it should restart soon enough.

## Commands

/realcrash - Crashes specified player Minecraft client (95% success rate)

/fakejavaerror - Kicks specified player from server with a fake Java exception that looks real

More commands will be coming soon...
